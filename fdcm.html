		<p>Few years ago (2011), during a local gathering in my city, Bandung, we discuss a "method" to solve a Rubik's Clock. Usually the steps involved on solving clock are the following:
		<ol>
			<li>Cross on Front Face, then align to 12.</li>
			<li>Flip the clock.</li>
			<li>Cross on Back Face</li>
			<li>Solve the corners</li>
		</ol>
		My friend, <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2011TAUF01">Fahmi Taufiqulhadi</a>, proposed that probably we can do step 1 and 3 altogether. So the method will be:
		<ol>
			<li>Cross on Front Face and Back Face, align to 12.</li>
			<li>Flip the clock.</li>
			<li>Solve the corners</li>
		</ol>
		He called that method "FDCM" (Fahmi Double Cross Method). Well, we don't know anyone who documented this method during that time. Personally, I consider this an "idea" and not yet a method.</p>
		
		<p>Here is some demonstration on simulator by my friend, <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2010WICA01">Cahyo Galuh Wicaksono</a>, pretty decent attempt on his third day after learning clock:</p>
		
		<p align="center"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBn1J6AB5zg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		
		<p>Notice after he flips the clock, the cross on the backside is already solved.</p>
		
		<p>There is a cuber I know who regularly use this method in official competition, <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2010KUSU02">Didiet Aditya Bayu Kusuma</a>.</p>
		
		<p>However, this method has drawbacks: A little math and memorization during inspection. But, I think one can be good at it with practice.</p>
		
		<h2>The Method</h2>
		
		<p>The easiest way to explain the method is by an example. Scramble the clock with:</p>
		
		<pre>
		UUdd u=-2,d=-2 / dUdU  u=2,d=2 / ddUU u=-1,d=-5 / UdUd u=2,d=-3 /
		dUUU u=4 / UdUU u=6 / UUUd u=-5 / UUdU u=-3 / UUUU u=5 / dddd d=0 /
		dUdU
		</pre>
		
		<p>Your clock should be look like this</p>
		
		Front:
		<pre>
		12  9  5
		 6  8  6
		11 10  8
		</pre>
		
		Back:
		<pre>
		 7  6 12
		10  8  5
		 4  3  1
		</pre>
		
		<h3>1. Inspection Phase</h3>
		
		<p>Here is the drawbacks of this idea: <b>doing math</b> and <b>memorization</b> during inspection! And remember, we only have 15 seconds to do it. Thankfully, the math is simple, it's just 4 subtractions.</p>
		
		<p>Now look at the Back Face, do the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Subtract center number (8) with <b>top edge</b> number (6) = 2</li>
			<li>Subtract center number (8) with <b>left edge</b> number (10) = -2</li>
			<li>Subtract center number (8) with <b>bottom edge</b> number (3) = 5</li>
			<li>Subtract center number (8) with <b>right edge</b> number (5) = 3</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>[Notice it's counter clockwise starting from top edge]</p>
		
		<p>So you need to memo: <b>2, -2, 5, 3</b></p>
		
		<h3>2. Double Cross Phase</h3>
		
		<p>Start from the <b>Front Face</b></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Position the pin as UUdd, align the center with <b>bottom edge</b>, to 10 [u=2]. Then do the <b>first</b> number that you memorized for d. [d=2]</li>
			<li>Position the pin as dUdU, align the center with <b>left edge</b>, to 8 [u=-2]. Then do the <b>second</b> number that you memorized for d. [d=-2]</li>
			<li>Position the pin as ddUU, align the center with <b>top edge</b>, to 9 [u=1]. Then do the <b>third</b> number that you memorized for d. [d=5]</li>
			<li>Position the pin as UdUd, align the center with <b>right edge</b>, to 7 [u=-2]. Then do the <b>third</b> number that you memorized for d. [d=3]</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>[Notice that it's clockwise startying from bottom edge, also the pin position is also same as scrambling]</p>
		
		<h3>3. Solve Corners</h3>
		<p>Flip the clock, you should see cross on backside. Solve corners like usual.</p>
